Inverterd index in a data structure which stores a mapping from contents, in this implementation I stored words and its file name. 
This implementaion is done using Hadoop with Java. 

EX:
Input:
file_names    contents 
file1.txt ==> Hello World Bye World
file2.txt ==> Hello Hadoop Goodbye Hadoop

Output:
Bye	    file1.txt
Goodbye	file2.txt
Hadoop	file2.txt,file2.txt
Hello	  file2.tx,file1.txt
World	  file1.txt,file1.txt
